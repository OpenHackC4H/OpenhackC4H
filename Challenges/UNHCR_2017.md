### About UNHCR
We are UNHCR, The UN Refugee Agency. We are responsible for ensuring that all member states of the 1951 Refugee Convention abide by the terms of the convention and respect international law. Our mission is to help people forced to flee their homes because of violence or persecution. We have a global mandate to help refugees and the stateless. We strive for long-term, durable and peaceful solutions to conflicts. Our support enables some of the world’s most vulnerable people to rebuild their lives, to find safety, education and employment.

### Background
As a UN Agency, we work closely with NGOs and governments to provide strong legal protections for refugees, asylum seekers and the stateless. One of the areas in which we need your help is our engagement with private employers. With the large movements of refugees into Europe and in particular Sweden during the past few years, we must now lean heavily on the private sector to provide pathways for employment and social integration.

One of the things that we are concerned about is discrimination in hiring practices. Discriminating against individuals on the basis of their background, religion, sex, gender or other identity factors harms those individuals’ prospects at finding meaningful, stable work. We know that refugees, asylum seekers and local Swedes alike all do better when hiring processes are fair, and that employers do best when the most apt candidate is the one that his hired. Unfortunately, this is often not the case, with many studies showing that even something as simple as a name change on an otherwise identical CV can produce wildly different response rates for the same position. Discrimination still exists, and we want your help to use technology to minimize or eliminate its role when hiring for jobs.

### Challenges and problem statement
How might technology help us to avoid discrimination in hiring practices?

We hope you see from our challenge question that this applies not only to refugees, but also to the local population, and indeed anyone who may face discrimination.

### Goals
We are looking for ideas that can be taken to employers, employment services or others involved in the HR and Recruitment space that they can adopt to avoid discrimination. UNHCR also runs an internal Innovation service who might be in contact.

We would also love to see if your solution can be integrated with service providers like Arbetsförmedlingen, LinkedIn, Monster, etc., and of course, we would love something which is open, extensible and able to be used in multiple languages and around the world.

### End-user
Being truly solution agnostic, we hope that our end users are anyone applying for work and anyone involved in the recruitment processes. This will probably involve HR, managers, divisional heads as well as job candidates themselves (refugees, asylum seekers and stateless in particular!).
