### Brief description
A service or tool to help young talents and employers to find each other in a digitalized gig economy.

### Background
The way we work is changing forever. Technologies—from automation to digital platforms for coordination of tasks—are reinventing not just what people do to earn a living but at a much deeper level how we organize to create value. In a way, Futurion is The Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees (TCO’s), response to this and a way for TCO, its member organizations and the 1.6 million Swedish professional employees to be more future adaptive.

### Challenge
In the next 10 years robotics and automation can replace 47% of all jobs now existing. New technologies also lead to a new paradigm in value creation. Many iconic start ups are huge successes, but also good examples of a jobless growth. When Volvo was sold to the Chinese company Geely it had 21.000 employees. When Mojang was sold to Microsoft, for about the same amount, they had 39 people working there.

Right now 1 out of 4 young Europeans are unemployed and not able to find a place to live, start a family etc. At the same time business across Europe, and especially in Sweden, is crying out that they need people to hire. But that they can’t find the right competence. In the coming years there will be a continuing large number of people fleeing from conflict coming to Europe. People in need for shelter and safety, but also people with skills, abilities and education. A huge potential for creating a sustainable growth in a rapidly aging Sweden and other European countries. We desperately need to find new and better ways of showing and matching the skills needed in the future labor market, seizing the opportunities with new and smarter ways of sharing ideas and services.

### Goal
To put it simple: I don’t care how you became an expert – I just want to know that you are one! How can we help companies and talents find each other? How can we speed up how refugees and immigrants get their first job? How can we make sure that the new digital and platform-based labor market reduces the present gaps between insiders and outsiders?

### End-user
Both talents already living in Sweden and other parts of Europe and people arriving from other parts of the world, as well as employers in Sweden and Europe.

### Requirements
No specific requirements on technical solutions. The tool needs to be relevant both in Sweden and in a European context.
