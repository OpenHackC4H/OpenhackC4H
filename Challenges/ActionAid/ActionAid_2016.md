### Brief description

New digital means of engagement with ActionAid on issues of solidarity and social justice!

### Background

ActionAid International is a federation with presence in 48 countries supporting individuals, organizations and movements for human rights, democracy, social justice and gender equality, primarily focusing on youth and women. AA aims at being a locally rooted, feminist, political and courageous organization. AA is a global referent on issues of tax justice, climate change and equality, i.a. In our new strategy (2017-27) we aim to leave the North vs South development aid paradigm and become a go-to organization for social justice, applying and adjusting our strategies and tools to any context, including Sweden. So far engagement between ActionAid Sweden and the Swedish public has focused on fund-raising, without providing much space for other kinds of engagement, which is now the challenge we face.

### Challenge

We want to communicate with our supporters and collaborators through their smart phones to make it possible for them to:

* sign petitions to be sent to politicians, companies or other power holders, in Sweden or abroad
* join activities like demonstrations, manifestations, media stunts, etc.
* sign up to support an ActionAid advocacy agenda
* receive information/news as background to the action to take
* show solidarity with an issue / group
* show solidarity with an issue / group by help funding action
* show solidarity by becoming a regular giver
* sign up for membership in ActionAid
* access different tools for social mobilization
* share anything in their wider networks
* adapt preferences so that the user is only in the loop of what she/he is interested in

### Goals

To have a digital platform which can provide strategic options for people to engage in issues of social justice in Sweden and abroad, tapping in to energy that today often doesn’t have an outlet. The aim is that it will make the work of ActionAid more rooted and more effective in our pursuit for social justice.

### End-user

ActionAid members, activists, volunteers, people on mailing-lists, the public. Anybody that shares our fundamental values and wish to be part of a movement set to fight social injustices.

### Requirements

An application for smart-phone able to reach as many normal users as possible.
