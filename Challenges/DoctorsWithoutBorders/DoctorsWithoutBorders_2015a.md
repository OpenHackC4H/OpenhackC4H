### Projects addressing challenge
[Cold Chain Sensors](https://github.com/OpenHackC4H/2015-Malmo-Cold-Chain-Sensors) - A temperature tracking system aimed to aid medicine transportation when temperature requirements are critical. 

### Background
The International Organization for Migration calls Europe the most dangerous destination for irregular migration in the world and the Mediterranean the world’s most dangerous border crossing. It is clear that the refugees live in a very insecure situation and face numerous threats on their way. The great strain they go through compounded by lack of access to reliable information causes them an extreme level of stress.

Improved access to information in this situation will make a significant difference to the refugees, make them less exploitable and less vulnerable, and make their journey more safe and less strenuous. It will lower their stress level and possibly impact their mental health and lead to better general condition. In this context, to provide information is to provide humanitarian support, to direct medical assistance and to maintain human dignity.

The number of refugees in Europe and elsewhere in the world is not forecasted to decrease; on the contrary, it will probably increase in the coming years. With this long-term perspective, it is important to invest in improving services for refugees in order to increase the sustainability and effectiveness of projects. Many organizations are already present in many of the countries that the refugees pass through, which gives them a unique position for providing assistance.

We want to improve the information sharing between organizations and aid workers in order to provide better services to refugees. To maintain, support and provide reliable and validated information in this context is a difficult and ambitious task. It is important to determine what content and method of information delivery will be best, how we can better share information internally and with the field teams, and how we can gather valuable information from the refugees about their journey in order for organizations and to be more proactive and provide better assistance in a longer term.

### Challenges
The refugees live in a rapidly-changing environment, where information has a short expiry date and comes from various sources. Information is often based on rumors or speculations and can rarely be taken for granted.

People come from various countries, speak different languages, have different means, and move in groups, in families or individually. To maintain, manage, collect and communicate updated and verified information for these diverse needs is a great challenge. We need a good understanding of the recipients, how their needs vary depending on context and how they might interpret information as well as possible consequences of providing information. We must know how to manage information we want to provide and be able to assess what will be sensible to provide in different situations.

Some information is sensitive, and conveying it can even be construed as a political act. We should provide information according to the refugees’ needs and wellbeing but at the same time be sure not to give advice that could infer political intentions. To determine what type of information we should provide and to whom is a great responsibility. Therefore, we need to be in control of the information that we provide, and we need to be aware of the possible consequences of providing it.

This is an ambitious and highly complex task with numerous stakeholders and perspectives to consider. Ultimately the effective dissemination of accurate, impactful information to migrants and field workers is at the core; the likely output of an application might seem relatively simple, though attaining an understanding and validation of the needs of the people affected of such a system is far more challenging.

### Objectives
